5. [Create a clean Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-pull-request)
    - Create a personal fork of the project on Github.
    - Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
    - Add the original repository as a remote called upstream using one of the following:
  
        `git remote add upstream https://github.ibm.com/payer/caps.git`

        or

        `git remote add upstream git@github.ibm.com:payer/caps.git`

        > If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
        Create a new branch to work on! Branch from master.
    - Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote origin.
      - stage changes for push:
  
        `git add .`

        or

        `git add [FILE PATH]`

      - make commit message:

        `git commit -m "your message"`

      - push your changes:

        `git push origin [your branch name]`
